        <p><b>A doomed prince with a monstrous curse.
          A sadistic king with a dark history.
          And the witch who will be his reckoning.</b></p>
        <p>Shivani, a talented witch, has so far avoided the annual Summoning.
          In her village, women are sent to the King each year and given six months to win the Prince’s heart and break his beastly curse.
          Anyone who can do so will be named Queen.</p>
        <p>No one has succeeded.</p>
        <p>Deep in debt and with the promise of a handsome reward, Shivani’s father volunteers
          her for the Summoning.
          Shivani is drugged to dull her witchcraft and taken to the castle against her will.</p>
        <p>With no magic and no allies, Shivani attempts a desperate escape through her only window.
          When she falls, Prince Theo sees her in time to catch her.
          An unlikely friendship forms as Shivani and Theo realise they are as trapped as each other –
          Theo cursed to uncontrollably transform into a beast and Shivani with a six-month countdown
          to an execution.</p>
        <p>When Shivani finds a long-forgotten tunnel deep in the castle,
          she could leave the horrors of the Summoning and the cruel King behind.
          But it wouldn’t save the Prince and it wouldn’t free the imprisoned servants.
          Or Shivani could stay – if she’s shrewd enough to decipher the curse before
          the executioner’s axe drops.</p>
        <p><i>Wrath of the Never Queen</i> is perfect for readers who crave a Fantasy Romance
          with low spice, feminine rage, and a main character who lets nothing stand in her way.</p>
        <h2>Praise for <i>Wrath of the Never Queen</i></h2>
        <p>"This plot is absolutely brilliant. The rich world-building and unique magic system
          held my attention and the flow of the story upheld my excitement.
          I felt I could scarcely put this down because I was so engrossed in what was going on.
          To the point that if I didn’t have to work, it would have been done in one delightful sitting."</p>
        <p>"The way this book had me in a chokehold... wow! If you’ve ever wanted to read a Beauty and
          the Beast retelling with way more magic/fantasy elements and an FMC with a well-developed
          sense of rage, this is absolutely the book for you. (And even if you’ve never thought that
          would be the kind of book you needed, trust me, you do.)"</p>
        <p>"I thought the relationships that were built between the female characters were wonderful
          and how strong the women were in this book. I loved that the author gave them so much power
          and that even when things were tough they were strong. This book was so deeply rich with story,
          characters, and descriptions a total must-read for any fantasy lover or fairytale lover."</p>
