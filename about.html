    <p>Hi! I'm Storm Lomax. I drink coffee and I write things.</p> 
    <p>I specialise in romance, fantasy, and horror (not always at the same time but it's weird how often
      they overlap).</p>
    <p>Here, you can find info about my books, my previously published flash fiction,
      and any upcoming events.</p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>

    <h1 class="h1">About Me</h1>
    <p>I've been writing stories since I knew what words were. One of my earliest memories 
        is staying inside during playtime at school to finish writing a story we were assigned.
        Everyone else wrote a page or two, but I couldn't stop thinking about the details of the world. 
        And I couldn't stop writing.</p>
        <p>I still haven't.</p>
        <p>In high school, I wrote stories for my friends about teenagers getting superpowers (it's inevitable).
        I wrote horror stories about monsters, and a haunted computer once.</p>
        <p>I consumed booked like nothing else, across all genres, and I still do.</p>
        <p>As an adult, I published a collection of short stories on Kindle. Not my best work, but I was
        so keen to get something out there. I started writing stories in earnest, with the goal of publishing
        something with polished prose and a solid plot. I started my first novel, about a ragtag group of 
        friends fighting zombies. Hopefully, I'll get around to finishing it.</p>
        <p>My concentration has always been up and down, so I focussed on short stories and flash fiction for a while.
        I got a few pieces published in literary magazines, anthologies, and even a podcast narration. It gave
        me the boost of confidence I needed to create a novel.</p>
        <p>And then I wrote Wrath of the Never Queen. My first finished full-length novel. It was only 30k words
        at first (it's now around 80k), but I actually finished it. After about 15 drafts, a bunch of beta readers,
        and a professional edit, I finallly got it to a place where I was happy with putting it into the world.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I might put the pen down, or I might switch to shorter pieces, or read manga instead of books,
        but I always, always come back to writing.</p>
